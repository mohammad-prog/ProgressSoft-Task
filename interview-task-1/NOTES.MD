- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
A Z-score is  measurement that describes a  relationship between values and  mean  
when measured in standard deviation units
If you and your friend are in two different classes
And you got a mark of 14 and your friend got a mark of 16
and the both classes have the same SD and the mean of your class 12 and your frind class 15
your mark is better than your friend mark 

Min-max helps to transform values to unified range used when min and max are well known 
This is useful because few variable values might be in thousands and few might be in small ranges



```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library?

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.

how to work with dependency injection and make my application  work with abstraction as much as possible /how to reduce redundant code


- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
Sorry, I didn't
